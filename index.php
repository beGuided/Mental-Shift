                    Hello ardent propellers of change. Before you is <b>IDOWU OLUWASANMI a.k.a ALUTA-BOOSTER </b>an aspirant for the office of Vice
                    President of the Degree Students Association{DSA}<br><br>

                 <h3> <i> What differentiates ALUTA-BOOSTER from the rest?</i></h3><br><br>

                    🖊️First, ALUTA-BOOSTER is a determined advocate and proponent of good leadership who strongly believes
                    that governance at any level has to be from the people, by the people and for the people. He is of the strong opinion and belief
                    that in the corridors of power, everything has to revolve around not the leaders, not the power brokers, not the stakeholders
                    but the people themselves who are the sources of the  power of any government. As such, the people are surely going to be the most
                    critical part of his role as Vice President of this Union because;<b> ALUTA-BOOSTER IS STRONGLY FOR THE PEOPLE</b>👨‍👩‍👦‍👦👨‍👩‍👧‍👧👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
                    <br><br><br>
                    🖊️Second, Genuineness of interest: The idea to serve the DSA didn't just pop up from mere willingness and sheer thoughts, rather it
                    came out of readiness and strong determination to make things better and also to propel high standards of values in the Union and
                    <br><br><br>
                    🖊️Third, Commitment to service: This is another reason why everyone needs to support this movement. ALUTA-BOOSTER has a genuine heart and as such, he remains doggedly committed to the service of the great Students' of our great union. To serve in a union like ours requires a whole lot of commitment and sticking to values and promises.
                    ALUTA-BOOSTER IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO EVERYONE.
